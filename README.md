- Challenge 1: Regression Approaches - I tried to predict paralisation time in traffic considering variables like the time of the day, the place and the weather when the accident happened. The database uses real data from US traffic reports, which was retrieved from Kaggle.
- Challenge 2: Binary and Multiclass Classification Approaches - I tried to evaluate wine quality through parameters like fixed acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, density and ph. The database analysed is the famous load_wine, available in sklearn.
- Challenge 3: Binary Classification Using Perceptron - The model tried to predict whether a credit transaction was a fraud or not based on a given dataset containing 26 renamed columns to preserve data security.
- Challenge 4: Neural Networks - Part A aims at implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize and differentiate cats, dogs and pandas from a sample of images. Part B explores Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process reviews and try to predict the overall grade the user gave to the service.
